        Last updated 5 August 2019

        <p>
            This is a changelog coded in HTML, for an app developed using
            <a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/">
                MIT App Inventor 2</a>,
            named Edukade.
        </p>

        <p>
            The versioning scheme follows <i>Semantic Versioning</i> rules as
            described in
            <a href="https://semver.org">semver.org</a>
            2.0.0 (retrieved 27 July 2019).
        </p>

        <h2>0.4.0 (3 August 2019)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapter 1 screen is now accessible</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the chapter select screen, pressing on ABC now redirects
                    to the chapter 1 screen
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The pressed-down sprite of the ABC button is yet to be
                        added
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    In the chapter 1 screen, the return button now actually
                    redirects to the chapter select screen, as planned
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Removed placeholder text underneath "A" and "B" in the chapter
                1 screen; now they are empty, pressable buttons that do not
                redirect to anywhere
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Bug found:</em>
                When pressing a button, if its pressed-down sprite does not
                appear but the finger is immediately lifted (making the button
                no longer pressed), the AI companion crashes. <strong>This has
                not yet been tested with the app actually compiled as an APK
                file.</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>0.3.0 (27 July 2019)</h2>

                    screen)
                </li>
                <li>Added books-on-a-table-in-nature background</li>
                <li>
                    Added a (not yet functioining) return button to return to
                    the chapter select screen
                </li>
                <li>
                    Starting to add levels, with labels A and B placed
                    appropriately on the bottom, and (not yet functioning)
                    buttons underneath each one both labeled "Text" as a
                    placeholder, later to be pressed to play the respective
                    level
                </li>
            </ul>

                    Added a (not yet functioning) button for chapter ABC, with a
                    label below intended to later display the player's score in
                    that chapter, but now containing "nilai: 100%" as
                    placeholder text representing a score of 100%

                    Added (not yet functioning) left arrow and right arrow

                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>
                The play button in the main menu screen now redirects to the

            </li>
        </ul>
